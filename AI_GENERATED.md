# AI Generated Project

This repository contains code generated entirely by AI.

## Project Details

- **Project**: ContactScrubby
- **AI Tool**: [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
- **Generation Date**: July 18, 2025
- **Method**: Conversational Programming ("vibe-coding")

## Development Process

This project was created through natural language interactions with Claude Code, demonstrating AI-assisted software development capabilities. The entire codebase was generated without traditional manual coding or IDE usage.

### Generated Components
