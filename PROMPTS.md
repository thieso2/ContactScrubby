# ContactScrubby Development Prompts

This file documents all the prompts used to develop the ContactScrubby CLI tool, showing the evolution of features and improvements over time.

## Early Development (Previous Sessions)

### 1. Initial Project Creation
```
[Inferred] Create a contacts CLI tool that can manage and analyze contacts
```
**Result**: Created initial ContactsCLI with comprehensive contact management features including filtering, export, and dubious contact detection.

### 2. Fix Dubious Filtering Logic
```
[Inferred] The dubious filtering minimum score logic isn't working correctly
```
**Result**: Fixed dubious filtering minimum score logic to properly identify contacts based on score thresholds.

### 3. Add Image Export Support
```
[Inferred] Add support for exporting contact images
```
**Result**: Added `--include-images` option for contact image export functionality.

### 4. Enhance Image Export Options
```
[Inferred] Improve image export with different modes
```
**Result**: Enhanced `--include-images` option with inline and folder modes for flexible image handling.

### 5. Modernize CLI Architecture
```
[Inferred] Refactor to use swift-argument-parser and better structure
```
**Result**: Refactored ContactsCLI to use swift-argument-parser and extracted models for better organization.

### 6. Complete Architecture Overhaul
```
[Inferred] Create a modular architecture with comprehensive testing
```
**Result**: Refactored ContactsCLI into modular architecture with comprehensive test suite and documentation.

### 7. Rename Project
```
[Inferred] Rename the project to ContactScrubby
```
**Result**: Renamed ContactsCLI to ContactScrubby with contactscrub executable name.

### 8. Add Development Documentation
```
[Inferred] Add documentation for future development
```
**Result**: Added CLAUDE.md for future Claude Code instances with development context.

### 9. Setup CI/CD Pipeline
```
[Inferred] Add continuous integration and deployment
```
**Result**: Added comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated testing and releases.

### 10. Code Quality Improvements
```
[Inferred] Fix code quality issues and linting
```
**Result**: Fixed all SwiftLint violations and optimized configuration for better code quality.

### 11. Add AI Development Markers
```
[Inferred] Add documentation showing this is an AI-generated project
```
**Result**: Added comprehensive AI-generated project markers and documentation.

### 12-18. CI/CD Pipeline Fixes
```
[Inferred] Multiple prompts to fix CI/CD issues with Swift versions and compatibility
```
**Result**: Series of fixes for CI/CD pipeline including:
- Target macOS 15 → macOS 14 compatibility
- Swift version fixes (5.8 → 5.9 → 5.10 → 5.9)
- Package dependencies compatibility
- GitHub Actions updates

### 19. Add Usage Help
```
[Inferred] Show help when no arguments are provided
```
**Result**: Added usage output when no arguments provided and updated version to v0.1.

## Recent Development Sessions

### 1. Show All Fields for Dubious Contacts
```
when showing dubious contact always show all fields
```
**Result**: Modified display logic to use `DisplayUtilities.printFullContactDetails()` for dubious contacts instead of the condensed view.

### 2. Add Duplicate Detection and Merging
```
add a feature to merge duplicates. come up with a smart strategy
```
**Result**: Created comprehensive duplicate detection system with:
- Multi-tier matching algorithms (exact, fuzzy, contact info, phonetic)
- `DuplicateManager.swift` with Levenshtein distance and Soundex matching
- CLI options: `--find-duplicates`, `--merge-duplicates`, `--merge-strategy`
- Confidence scoring and merge strategies (conservative, mostComplete, interactive)

### 3. Contact Count Discrepancy Investigation
```
why does --backup report 461 contact and --dum says Total: 1068 contact(s)
```
**Result**: Discovered that the default filter was `.withEmail`, causing backup to only export contacts with email addresses while dump showed all contacts.

### 4. Change Default Filter
```
the default filter should be 'all'
```
**Result**: Changed default filter from `.withEmail` to `.all` in `ContactScrubby.swift`, updated tests and help text.

### 5. Git Push
```
push
```
**Result**: Pushed all changes to remote repository.

### 6. Rename Flag and Add Hidden Fields Display
```
rename --dump to --all-fields and display number of hidden fields in the normal view
```
**Result**: 
- Renamed `--dump` flag to `--all-fields` throughout codebase
- Added `countHiddenFields()` function with CNContact key availability checks
- Modified normal display to show "(+X more fields - use --all-fields to see)"
- Updated all tests to use new flag name

### 7. Commit and Push Changes
```
commit and push
```
**Result**: Committed and pushed the rename and hidden fields functionality.

### 8. Replace Count with Field Names
```
instead of "(+2 more fields - use --all-fields to see)" show a comma seperated list of the field-names not shown.
```
**Result**: 
- Replaced `countHiddenFields()` with `getHiddenFieldNames()`
- Changed display to show specific field names: "(+organization, job title, URL, birthday - use --all-fields to see)"
- Added proper pluralization for multi-item fields
- Used user-friendly field names

### 9. Simplify Display Format
```
change "(+organization, job title, URL, birthday - use --all-fields to see)" to "(hidden: organization, job title, URL, birthday)"
```
**Result**: Updated display format to cleaner, more concise "(hidden: field1, field2, ...)" format.

### 10. Final Commit and Push
```
commit and push
```
**Result**: Committed and pushed the final display format improvements.

### 11. Documentation Request
```
can you create a file with all prompts that i ve used to create this and keep that file up to date
```
**Result**: Created this PROMPTS.md file documenting the development history.

### 12. Documentation Correction
```
thies does not show all prompts. don't you remember our full histry? come on!
```
**Result**: Acknowledged missing early development history and updated this file to reflect the gap.

## Key Features Developed

### Core Features (Early Development)
1. **Contact Management**: List, filter, and analyze contacts
2. **Export System**: JSON/XML export with image handling
3. **Dubious Detection**: Identify suspicious/incomplete contacts
4. **Group Management**: Add contacts to groups
5. **Multiple Filters**: Email-based, Facebook-specific, and other filters

### Recent Enhancements
1. **Duplicate Detection & Merging**: Smart algorithms with confidence scoring
2. **Improved Display**: Better field visibility and user-friendly output
3. **Default Filter Change**: Show all contacts by default instead of email-only
4. **Flag Rename**: More descriptive `--all-fields` instead of `--dump`
5. **Hidden Field Display**: Show specific field names instead of just counts
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: All features thoroughly tested with passing test suite

## Development Pattern

The development followed a pattern of:
1. **Initial Setup** → Core functionality and architecture
2. **Feature Request** → Implementation of new capabilities
3. **Issue Discovery** → Investigation and fixes
4. **UX Improvement** → Iterative refinement of user experience
5. **Testing** → Verification of functionality
6. **Documentation** → Recording development history

Each prompt built upon previous work, creating a robust contact management tool with intuitive user interface and powerful duplicate detection capabilities.

## Note on Missing History

This file was created during active development and may not capture all the initial prompts used to create the foundational features of ContactScrubby. The early development history could be reconstructed from git commit messages and code analysis if needed.
