# ContactScrubby Development Prompts

This file documents all the prompts used to develop the ContactScrubby CLI tool, showing the evolution of features and improvements over time.

## Session 1: Initial Development & Core Features

### 1. Show All Fields for Dubious Contacts
```
when showing dubious contact always show all fields
```
**Result**: Modified display logic to use `DisplayUtilities.printFullContactDetails()` for dubious contacts instead of the condensed view.

### 2. Add Duplicate Detection and Merging
```
add a feature to merge duplicates. come up with a smart strategy
```
**Result**: Created comprehensive duplicate detection system with:
- Multi-tier matching algorithms (exact, fuzzy, contact info, phonetic)
- `DuplicateManager.swift` with Levenshtein distance and Soundex matching
- CLI options: `--find-duplicates`, `--merge-duplicates`, `--merge-strategy`
- Confidence scoring and merge strategies (conservative, mostComplete, interactive)

### 3. Contact Count Discrepancy Investigation
```
why does --backup report 461 contact and --dum says Total: 1068 contact(s)
```
**Result**: Discovered that the default filter was `.withEmail`, causing backup to only export contacts with email addresses while dump showed all contacts.

### 4. Change Default Filter
```
the default filter should be 'all'
```
**Result**: Changed default filter from `.withEmail` to `.all` in `ContactScrubby.swift`, updated tests and help text.

### 5. Git Push
```
push
```
**Result**: Pushed all changes to remote repository.

## Session 2: UI/UX Improvements

### 6. Rename Flag and Add Hidden Fields Display
```
rename --dump to --all-fields and display number of hidden fields in the normal view
```
**Result**: 
- Renamed `--dump` flag to `--all-fields` throughout codebase
- Added `countHiddenFields()` function with CNContact key availability checks
- Modified normal display to show "(+X more fields - use --all-fields to see)"
- Updated all tests to use new flag name

### 7. Commit and Push Changes
```
commit and push
```
**Result**: Committed and pushed the rename and hidden fields functionality.

### 8. Replace Count with Field Names
```
instead of "(+2 more fields - use --all-fields to see)" show a comma seperated list of the field-names not shown.
```
**Result**: 
- Replaced `countHiddenFields()` with `getHiddenFieldNames()`
- Changed display to show specific field names: "(+organization, job title, URL, birthday - use --all-fields to see)"
- Added proper pluralization for multi-item fields
- Used user-friendly field names

### 9. Simplify Display Format
```
change "(+organization, job title, URL, birthday - use --all-fields to see)" to "(hidden: organization, job title, URL, birthday)"
```
**Result**: Updated display format to cleaner, more concise "(hidden: field1, field2, ...)" format.

### 10. Final Commit and Push
```
commit and push
```
**Result**: Committed and pushed the final display format improvements.

### 11. Documentation Request
```
can you create a file with all prompts that i ve used to create this and keep that file up to date
```
**Result**: Created this PROMPTS.md file documenting the development history.

## Key Features Developed

1. **Duplicate Detection & Merging**: Smart algorithms with confidence scoring
2. **Improved Display**: Better field visibility and user-friendly output
3. **Default Filter Change**: Show all contacts by default instead of email-only
4. **Flag Rename**: More descriptive `--all-fields` instead of `--dump`
5. **Hidden Field Display**: Show specific field names instead of just counts
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: All features thoroughly tested with passing test suite

## Development Pattern

The development followed a pattern of:
1. **Feature Request** → Implementation
2. **Issue Discovery** → Investigation and Fix
3. **UX Improvement** → Iterative refinement
4. **Testing** → Verification of functionality
5. **Documentation** → Recording development history

Each prompt built upon previous work, creating a robust contact management tool with intuitive user interface and powerful duplicate detection capabilities.
