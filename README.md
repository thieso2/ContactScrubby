## Installation

### Prerequisites
- macOS 10.15 or later
- Swift 5.8 or later
- Xcode 14.0 or later (for development)

### Build from Source

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ContactScrubby.git
cd ContactScrubby
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
swift build -c release
```

3. Copy the executable to your PATH:
```bash
cp .build/release/contactscrub /usr/local/bin/
```

### Using Swift Package Manager

Add to your `Package.swift`:
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/yourusername/ContactScrubby.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Display all contacts with email addresses
contactscrub

# Show help
contactscrub --help

# Show version
contactscrub --version
```

### Filtering Options

The `--filter` (or `-f`) option supports these modes:

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `with-email` | Contacts with email addresses (default) |
| `no-email` | Contacts without email addresses |
| `facebook` | Contacts with @facebook.com email addresses |
| `facebook-exclusive` | Contacts with ONLY @facebook.com emails and no phone numbers |
| `dubious` | Contacts identified as suspicious or incomplete |
| `all` | All contacts |

```bash
# Show contacts without email addresses
contactscrub --filter no-email

# Show dubious contacts with minimum score of 5
contactscrub --filter dubious --dubious-score 5

# Show all Facebook contacts
contactscrub --filter facebook
```

### Export Formats

Export contacts to JSON or XML files:

```bash
# Export to JSON
contactscrub --backup contacts.json

# Export to XML with images as base64
contactscrub --backup contacts.xml --include-images inline

# Export with images in separate folder
contactscrub --backup contacts.json --include-images folder

# Export filtered contacts
contactscrub --filter dubious --backup suspicious.json
```

### Contact Analysis

The dubious contact detection system uses a scoring algorithm to identify problematic contacts:

```bash
# Show dubious contacts (default threshold: 3)
contactscrub --filter dubious

# Show highly dubious contacts (threshold: 5)
contactscrub --filter dubious --dubious-score 5

# Export all dubious contacts
contactscrub --filter dubious --backup dubious.json
```

#### Scoring Criteria

| Issue | Score | Category |
|-------|-------|----------|
| No name provided | +2 | Incomplete |
| Generic/suspicious name | +3 | Suspicious |
| Very short name | +2 | Suspicious |
| All caps/lowercase name | +1 | Suspicious |
| Facebook-only email, no phone | +3 | Suspicious |
| Numeric email username | +2 | Suspicious |
| No-reply email address | +2 | Suspicious |
| Missing 2+ basic fields | +1 | Incomplete |
| Only name + email | +2 | Incomplete |
| Suspicious phone pattern | +2 | Suspicious |

### Group Management

Add filtered contacts to groups:

```bash
# Add dubious contacts to "Suspicious" group
contactscrub --filter dubious --add-to-group "Suspicious"

# Add Facebook contacts to "Facebook" group
contactscrub --filter facebook --add-to-group "Facebook"
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Show all contact fields for debugging
contactscrub --dump

# Combine multiple options
contactscrub --filter dubious --dubious-score 2 --backup suspicious.json --include-images folder
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Clean Up Your Contacts

```bash
# 1. Identify dubious contacts
contactscrub --filter dubious

# 2. Export them for review
contactscrub --filter dubious --backup review.json

# 3. Add them to a group for manual review
contactscrub --filter dubious --add-to-group "Review"
```

### Example 2: Export Facebook Contacts

```bash
# 1. See how many Facebook contacts you have
contactscrub --filter facebook

# 2. Export them with images
contactscrub --filter facebook --backup facebook_contacts.json --include-images folder

# 3. Export only Facebook-exclusive contacts
contactscrub --filter facebook-exclusive --backup facebook_only.xml
```

### Example 3: Contact Database Analysis

```bash
# 1. Show all contacts
contactscrub --filter all

# 2. Show contacts without emails
contactscrub --filter no-email

# 3. Export comprehensive report
contactscrub --filter dubious --dubious-score 1 --backup full_analysis.json
```

## Architecture

contactscrub follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
